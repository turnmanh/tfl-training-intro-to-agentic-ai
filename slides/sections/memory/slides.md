| Memory Type  | What is Stored | Human Example | Agent Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| _Semantic_  | Facts  | Things I learned in school   | Facts about a user   |
| _Episodic_    | Experiences   | Things I did                 | Past agent actions   |
| _Procedural_  | Instructions  | Instincts or motor skills    | Agent system prompt  |

- Information learned in school and the understanding of concepts and their
relationships.
- Used to personalize applications by remembering facts or concepts.
- Organization e.g. in profiles or collections.

title: Episodic Memory
subtitle: Long-term Memory
---

- Recalling past events or actions.
- Facts can be written to semantic memory, whereas experiences can be written to episodic memory.
- Few-shot examples or summaries of past interactions.
- Showing / telling, i.e., describing, can be easier than programming.

title: Procedural Memory
subtitle: Long-term Memory
---

::grid{cols=5 width=90}

:::box{color=white span=3 align=center}
- Remembering the rules used to perform tasks.
- Combination of model weights, agent code, and agent‚Äôs prompt that collectively determine the agent‚Äôs functionality.
- Agents can modify their prompts based on experiences, e.g., via _reflection_.

- Real-time vs. Latency and Quality
- Transparency vs. Redundancy
- See [memory-agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-agent) for _in the
  hot path_ example.
- See [memory-service](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-template) for _in
  the background_ example.

1. Open the file `src/agents/TASK_tool_agent_with_memory.md` and add thread memory.
2. Think about how to add a filtering mechanism to keep the context relevant.
