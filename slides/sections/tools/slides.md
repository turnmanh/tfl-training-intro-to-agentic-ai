**Tools are central to most agentic systems**

They deserve as much attention as your prompts ‚ÄºÔ∏è
:::

:::box{color=blue }
**How Tools Work**

Enable LLMs to interact with external services/APIs through specified structure
and definition, usually RPCs.

Capable models include tool use blocks in API response when planning to invoke a tool.

**Example Tool Call Request**

```txt
User: what's the weather like in munich?
...

Tool Calls: [{'name': 'forecast_weather', 'args': {'location': 'munich'}, 'id': 'a01bd898-4dd7-4095-a87b-ca0aacda5fd2', 'type': 'tool_call'}]

subtitle: Key Suggestions
---

::grid{columns=1 gap=lg width=90}
:::box{color=white text=md}
**1. Give the model thinking space**

Enough tokens to "think" before writing itself into a corner
:::

:::box{color=blue text=md}
**2. Keep format natural**

Close to what model has seen on the internet
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=md}
**3. Minimize formatting overhead**

No accurate counting of thousands of lines, no string-escaping code

**üí° Rule of Thumb:**

Invest as much effort in ACI as you would in HCI (Human-Computer Interface)

::grid{columns=1 gap=sm width=90}
:::box{color=blue text=sm}
**ü§î Put yourself in the model's shoes**

Is it obvious how to use this tool from description and parameters?
:::

:::box{color=white text=sm}
**üìù Write like for a junior developer**

Clear parameter names, comprehensive descriptions
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=sm}
**üìö Include essential details**

Example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, boundaries from other tools
:::

:::box{color=grey text=sm}
**‚ö†Ô∏è Especially important with similar tools**

Make distinctions clear

title: Tool Testing & Iteration
---

::grid{columns=1 gap=lg width=90}
:::box{color=blue text=md}
**üß™ Test extensively**

Run many example inputs in workbench, see what mistakes the model makes
:::

:::box{color=white text=md}
**üîÑ Iterate based on findings**

Adjust based on observed errors
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=md}
**üõ°Ô∏è Poka-yoke your tools**

Change arguments to make mistakes harder (error-proofing)

title: Developing MCP Servers

Have a look into modules at `src/tools/finance_tools` for reference.

```python
mcp = FastMCP("Yahoo Finance Tools")
...

@mcp.tool(tags={"finance", "read", "info", "s+p500", "stocks"})
def get_stocks_listed_in_s_and_p_500() -> str:
    """Get the list of stocks listed in the S&P 500 index.

    The data was obtained from kaggle with data from Q1 of 2025.
    Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks

    Returns:
        A JSON string containing the list of stocks in the S&P 500 index.
    """
    stocks: dict = get_stocks_in_s_and_p_500()
    return json.dumps(stocks, indent=2)
```

```python
@mcp.tool(tags={"finance", "read", "info"})
def get_stock_price(
    ticker: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(
            ...,
            description="The ticker identifying the stock. Search for it using the tool if it's not known to you.",
        ),
    ],
) -> str:
    """Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.
        ...
        ...
```

title: Automatic Validation and Casting of Parameters 
---

MCP provides data parsing and validation. 

Given: 
```python
@jira_mcp.tool(tags={"jira", "read"})
async def get_issue(
    ctx: Context,
    ...
```

The agent's input is parsed as desired type, e.g., Context. This is achieved
using the **spread operator** or **dictionary unpacking**.

```python
get_issue(ctx=Context(**llm_params), ...)
```

title: Inspecting MCP Servers

Inspect tools, prompts, resources etc. provided by a MCP server via:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

title: Extending the Tool Use Agent with More Tools ‚å®Ô∏è
text: lg

---

1. Open the file `src/tools/TASK.md` and read the description of the **second** (2Ô∏è‚É£) task.
2. Implement more tools for the MCP server by adding them in `src/tools/finance_tools/yahoo_finance.py` as needed. Feel free to
   implemented the suggested tools or create your own.
3. Interact with your agent by running it as
    ```bash
    uv run python -m src.agents.tool_agent
    ```
