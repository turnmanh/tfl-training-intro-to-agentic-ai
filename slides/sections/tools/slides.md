**Tools are central to most agentic systems**

They deserve as much attention as your prompts
:::

:::box{color=blue text=md}
**How Tools Work:**

Enable Claude to interact with external services/APIs through specified structure and definition

Claude includes tool use block in API response when planning to invoke a tool

::grid{columns=1 gap=md width=90}

**Example:** Specifying file edits
- Write a diff (requires knowing line counts in advance)
- Rewrite entire file
:::

:::box{color=blue text=sm}
**Example:** Structured output
- Code in markdown (natural)
- Code in JSON (requires escaping newlines/quotes)
:::
::

:vspace{size=sm}

*Some formats are much harder for LLMs to write, despite being functionally equivalent*

subtitle: Key Suggestions
---

::grid{columns=1 gap=lg width=90}
:::box{color=white text=md}
**1. Give the model thinking space**

Enough tokens to "think" before writing itself into a corner
:::

:::box{color=blue text=md}
**2. Keep format natural**

Close to what model has seen on the internet
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=md}
**3. Minimize formatting overhead**

No accurate counting of thousands of lines, no string-escaping code

title: Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)
subtitle: Design Principles
align: center
---

::grid{columns=1 width=80}
:::box{color=grey text=lg}
**üí° Rule of Thumb:**

Invest as much effort in ACI as you would in HCI (Human-Computer Interface)

::grid{columns=1 gap=sm width=90}
:::box{color=blue text=sm}
**ü§î Put yourself in the model's shoes**

Is it obvious how to use this tool from description and parameters?
:::

:::box{color=white text=sm}
**üìù Write like for a junior developer**

Clear parameter names, comprehensive descriptions
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=sm}
**üìö Include essential details**

Example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, boundaries from other tools
:::

:::box{color=grey text=sm}
**‚ö†Ô∏è Especially important with similar tools**

Make distinctions clear
:::
::

---
title: Tool Testing & Iteration
---

::grid{columns=1 gap=lg width=90}
:::box{color=blue text=md}
**üß™ Test extensively**

Run many example inputs in workbench, see what mistakes the model makes
:::

:::box{color=white text=md}
**üîÑ Iterate based on findings**

Adjust based on observed errors
:::

:::box{color=dark-blue text=md}
**üõ°Ô∏è Poka-yoke your tools**

Change arguments to make mistakes harder (error-proofing)
:::

title: Real Example
subtitle: SWE-bench Tool Optimization
---

::grid{columns=1 gap=md width=90}
:::box{color=blue text=sm}
**Context:** Building agent for SWE-bench

*More time spent optimizing tools than overall prompt*
:::

:::box{color=grey text=sm}
**‚ùå Problem:**

Model made mistakes with relative filepaths after moving out of root directory
:::

:::box{color=white text=sm}
**‚úì Solution:**

Changed tool to always require absolute filepaths
:::

:::box{color=blue text=sm}
**üéØ Result:**

Model used this method flawlessly

1. Open the file `src/tools/TASK.md` and read the description of the **second** (2Ô∏è‚É£) task.
2. Implement more tools for the MCP server by adding them in `src/tools/finance_tools/yahoo_finance.py` as needed. Feel free to
   implemented the suggested tools or create your own.
