# ReAct Agent from the Ground Up

This repository demonstrates how to build a ReAct agent using LangChain and
visualize it with LangGraph Studio. The agent can interact with the environment
using tools.

## Setup

Install the required dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

Launch the LangGraph Studio to visualize and manage the agent via

```shell
langgraph dev
```

Make sure that a valid api key for LangSmith is set in the .env file.
